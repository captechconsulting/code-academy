**Amazon Developer Console:** Where the Alexa VUI logic lives; where you define your skill’s intents and utterances.  

**Amazon Web Services (AWS):** This is the cloud service we are using. It is where the lambda function is created for the skill.  

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The ability of a computer to think and learn in the way a human does (i.e. - making a computer “smart”). Examples can include but are not limited to speech and facial recognition.

**Cloud:** Storage and servers that are located elsewhere, not on your own computer 

**GitHub:** A cloud-based resource that acts as both a collaborative workspace and a back-up for your code. This is where all the sample code and PowerPoints live. 

**GitHub Repo:** Repository (place) where your project code is saved 

**Intents:** What you want the skill to do for you (ex: tell the time, tell the weather) 

**Interface:** What allows people to interact/communicate with your program. 

**Invocation:** Words used to start your skill – the name of your skill. 

**JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation; the text format used to define a skill’s intents and utterances.  

**Lambda Function:** Small anonymous bits of code that will carry out what you want the skill to do. This is the brains of the skill.  

**Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Machines learning your speaking patterns to figure out the intent of the command you say to Alexa 

**Python:** The programming language we will be using 

**Slack:** A messaging application. You can create group chats to easily stay in communication even over long distances 

**Utterance:** All the different ways someone could say an intent (ex: what is the time? Tell me the time. How late is it?)
